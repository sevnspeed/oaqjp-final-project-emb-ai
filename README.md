# Repository for final project

Scenario
You have been hired as a software engineer by an e-commerce company to create an AI-based web app that performs analytics on customer feedback for their signature products. To accomplish this requirement, you will create an Emotion Detection system that processes feedback provided by the customer in text format and deciphers the associated emotion expressed.

Introduction
In this project, we use the embeddable Watson AI libraries to create an emotion detection application.

Emotion detection extends the concept of sentiment analysis by extracting the finer emotions, like joy, sadness, anger, and so on, from statements rather than the simple polarity that sentiment analysis provides. This makes emotion detection a very important branch of study and businesses use such systems widely for their AI based recommendation systems, automated chat bots, and so on.

Project guidelines
For the completion of this project, you'll have to complete the following 8 tasks, based on the knowledge you have gained through the course.

Tasks and objectives:
Task 1: Fork and Clone the project repository
Task 2: Create an emotion detection application using Watson NLP library
Task 3: Format the output of the application
Task 4: Package the application
Task 5: Run Unit tests on your application
Task 6: Deploy as web application using Flask
Task 7: Incorporate Error handling for blank input status code 400
Task 8: Run static code analysis on server.py

Note
mywebscript.js and index.html were provided and not edited for the lab, other code was written by me to be graded on.
